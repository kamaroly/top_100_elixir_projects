### Inspiration

The original idea comes from [EvanLi/Github-Ranking](https://github.com/EvanLi/Github-Ranking). I wanted to track only PHP projects, and code something from scratch.

### Disclaimer

*Fun fact* : I know literally nothing about Ruby. The [code itself](https://github.com/ozh/top_100_PHP_projects/blob/master/parse.rb) was **100% generated** by [Github Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/).I typed the comments to indicate what I was trying to achieve, and all the code was written by the AI. *All. The. Code*. Isn't it amazing ? ü§©

### License

Do whatever the hell you want with it. I mean, it's not even my code.
